## Lessons Learned

### Double Dot

If you review the [Double Dot](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/..) macro's documentation, they even provide the reasoinnig which is `easier to read, write etc`. Why note this? Because the clojure docs are truly a wealth of info, they just sometimes, often times, take a little bit of practice to learn where that treasure lives.

### Parens

Another big reminder from this is always watch your parens. Likely that if the syntax looks correct, your parens are probably fucking with you.
