# ClojureScript 30

This repo illustrates the projects I worked on which enabled me to go from an [early to beginner ](https://zedshaw.com/2015/06/16/early-vs-beginning-coders/) Clojure/ClojureScript (clj/cljs) developer.

Aside from teaching myself clj/cljs, I believe that clj/cljs is missing approachable documentation.  Maybe this repo can help round out some of the missing components for future learners.

# Background

Please note that I am a developer by trade, so I went into this with a solid understanding of development patterns and languages and most importantly **how** to learn languages.

If you are to this, or any other language, do not let the above paragraph discourage you.  When I wrote this I was, still and likely never will be a programming prodigy.  What I do is grind it out and never stop myself from asking questions, no matter how foolish they may seem.

# Special Thanks

I want to thank [wes bos](https://github.com/wesbos) for providing an amazing course that I believe could be used to help developers learn not just JavaScript, but any language that compiles to JS.  For example:

  * Elm
  * ClojureScript
  * Dart
  * ElixirScript

and the above list goes on, but the ones I mentioned are the ones that are more interesting to me and likely more well known.

Next thanks goes to the whole of the [clj/cljs community](http://clojurians.net/) which is by far one of the friendliest, most willing and easily accesibly communities I have experienced.  Treat them with respect!
