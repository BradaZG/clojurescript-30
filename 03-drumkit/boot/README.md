# Drumkit

# Quickstart

Run the following commands from the root of the `03-drumkit` repo

**1. Build and watch the project**

```bash
boot dev
```

**2. Sanity Check**

The above step will compile your `cljs` code in the `src` directory and create a new directory in the root of this project called `target`. Inside of `target` you will find an `index.html` file. Open that file in a browser and you should see a blank white screen. Open the web developer console and you should see a console log of `Hello World!`.
